# My-first-RPG
This is a small action RPG developed in Unity, loosely inspired by games like *Diablo*. The player controls their character via mouse clicks to interact with the game world – such as moving around or attacking enemies.

## 🎮 Features

- 🖱️ **Mouse-Based Interaction**  
  Click to move your character or attack enemies.

- 🧭 **NavMesh Navigation**  
  Player and NPCs use Unity’s NavMesh system for realistic movement. Some areas are intentionally unreachable.

- ⚔️ **Weapons & Items**  
  Pick up and use various weapons throughout the game.

- 📈 **Leveling System**  
  Gain experience points by defeating enemies and level up your character.

- 🌍 **Scene Transitions**  
  Seamlessly move between different game scenes.

- 💾 **Save & Load**  
  Save your game progress and continue later.

This project serves as a learning experience and a playground for experimenting with various Unity features related to gameplay, navigation, and game design.
